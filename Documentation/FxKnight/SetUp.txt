Custom Indicators & Chart Templates for MT4
-------------------------------------------
  
  
1)  Exit MetaTrader (if running)

  
2)  Launch Windows Filer Explorer or double-click on My Computer
    and click on the Folders button on your toolbar
  

3)  Hold down your CTRL key and left-click to select both the "expects" and "templates" folders
    which came as part of this Zip package and drag them into your broker's folder in C:\Program Files\
    (when asked whether to overwrite, select "Yes to All")
  

4)  Re-start MetaTrader
  

5)  Right-click in an empty area of any chart and load any of the following templates:

       fxKnight GMT     - Used the majority of the time, except when NY is trading alone
       fxKnight EST     - Used after London close, from 12:00 - 17:00 EST
       fxKnight EST5    - Used when NY recalculates their pivots at 17:00 EST, until Asian open
       fxKnight Futures - Used for trading index futures and commodities (24 hrs)
       fxKnight Gold    - Used for trading gold, and other precious metals subject to the London fix


6)  The pivot point settings on your templates are configured for GMT-based brokers by default.
    To find your broker's GMT offset, compare the right-most time stamp on your M1 chart with
    http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/ - then add or subtract your offset to the following values:

       April - September:         October - March:

       fxKnight GMT     - 0       fxKnight GMT     - 0
       fxKnight EST     - 4       fxKnight EST     - 5
       fxKnight EST5    - 21      fxKnight EST5    - 22
       fxKnight Futures - 21      fxKnight Futures - 22
       fxKnight Gold    - 14      fxKnight Gold    - 15

    To adjust your pivot settings, right-click on a Daily Pivot line and select Properties, then
    go to the Inputs tab and double-click next to StartHour.  Repeat this procedure for the Daily
    Medians and re-save your template so that you can have the new settings on each new chart.
    We recommend saving two versions of each template, one for summer and one for winter.


7)  To configure your Fibs, please see Fibs.PDF (included).  Below are the latest settings:

8)  In order to enable the Training Wheels features, right-click on the Tunnel of 5's on your chart
    (either of the two parallel purple dotted lines), and select "Tunnel of 5's properties" at the top
    
    Select the 2nd tab from the left, titled "Inputs", and scroll down until you get to the various
    green objects whose names begin with "Show" (there are 5 of them in total)

    Switch on as many you need by double-clicking on the word "false" and using the down arrow to
    change it to "true"

    Click "OK" when done


9)  To manage your stops and targets right from your chart, make sure you have a smiley face next to
    the words "Visual Trader" in the upper-right corner of your chart.  If, instead, you see an "x",
    simply press down the "Expert Advisors" button on the toolbar the top of your MetaTrader screen
    (green is on, red is off).  If you see a sad face, press F7, and under the "Common" tab make sure
    that "Allow live trading" is checked

    Once a stop and target is entered, you will see a blue line representing your entry, a red line marking
    your current stop, and a green line where your target is set.  Activate either line by double-clicking
    on it (white squares at each end will confirm that it has been activated), and then simply click & drag
    to where you want the new level to be.  Your order will be adjusted and sent to your broker automatically

  
Good hunting!
